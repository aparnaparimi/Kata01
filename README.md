# Kata01: Supermarket Pricing
This kata arose from some discussions here: http://codekata.com/kata/kata01-supermarket-pricing/

The problem domain is something seemingly simple: pricing goods at supermarkets.

Some things in supermarkets have simple prices: this can of beans costs $0.65. Other things have more complex prices. For example:

three for a dollar (so whatâ€™s the price if I buy 4, or 5?)
$1.99/pound (so what does 4 ounces cost?)
buy two, get one free (so does the third item have a price?)
This kata involves no coding. The exercise is to experiment with various models for representing money and prices that are flexible enough to deal with these (and other) pricing schemes, and at the same time are generally usable (at the checkout, for stock management, order entry, and so on).

# Goal
The goal of this kata is to practice a looser style of experimental modelling. Look for as many different ways of handling the issues as possible. Consider the various tradeoffs of each. What techniques are best for exploring these models? For recording them? How can you validate a model is reasonable?
